# Abstract
Accurate segmentation of cell nuclei in histopathology images plays a vital role in diagnosing and predicting the progression of cancer and various illnesses. Leveraging Artificial Intelligence in this segmentation task empowers pathologists to discern and analyze the distinct characteristics of individual cells, unveiling valuable insights about the disease, its stage, and optimal treatment strategies. However, sharing the data across different organizations is, in most cases, an impractical option, thus this paper presents a study for a proposed solution to handle data privacy issue by empowering Federated Learning (FL) training approach. We employed the PanNuke dataset, which consists of more than 200K labeled nuclei, over around 8K pairs of image/mask, modeled with a multi-class classification and segmentation U-Net architecture. Highlighting the result of traditional learning methods compared to the FL method in the context of histopathology. The traditional learning approach achieved 84% average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 82% average Intersection over Union (IoU). While the FL approach achieved an 80% Average DSC and 77% average IoU. This paper serves as a steppingstone for future research in the integration of histopathology wand federated learning.
